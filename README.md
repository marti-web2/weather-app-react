	<h1>Welcome to My Weather App</h1>
	<h2>Overview</h2>
	<p>This is a simple weather app that allows users to search for the current weather conditions in any location around the world. The app displays the current temperature, weather conditions, and a five-day forecast for the selected location.</p>
	<p>The app uses real-time weather data provided by a third-party weather API, which is accessed via an HTTP request from the client-side app. The user interface is built using React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. React allows you to create reusable UI components and efficiently update the view when the underlying data changes.</p>
	<p>The app's styling is powered by Tailwind, a utility-first CSS framework that provides a set of low-level utility classes for styling HTML elements directly. Tailwind makes it easier to build custom designs more quickly, as you don't have to write as much CSS. The CSS for this project is processed using PostCSS, a tool for transforming CSS with JavaScript. PostCSS allows you to use JavaScript plugins to analyze and manipulate your CSS, making it easier to maintain and extend your stylesheets.</p>
